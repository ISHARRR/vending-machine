For this project, I took an agile approach I followed the CRUD methodology

I started by designing, creating and then testing the different CURD elements, implementing them one at a time and testing after each implementation.

Design
1. Setting up the App/Main Class
2. Created all the packages related to MVC
3. Starting with the model - items
4. Importing the predesigned view and then implementing it accordingly
5. designing and implementing the Dao interface
6. Running test throughout and at the end of this sprint

Implementing
1. Starting with the most difficult method Dao
2. Creating the run method and then adding the method most recently designed
3. Designing and creating the related view aspects
4. Updating the Main/App as required
5. Testing throughout and at the end, and designed unit tests
6. Repeated for the rest of the CRUD/Dao elements
7. Implemented the file marshalling elements
8. Implemented the elements of the relevant exception
9. Revisited testing
10. Updated Exceptions for audit implementation
11. Implementing the audit
12. Design and implementing the service layer and updating the controller as required
13. Revisiting the audit and implementing the log
14. Designing and implementing the related interface
15. Updating the Main/App Class
16. Re-running unit tests and adding/updating as required
